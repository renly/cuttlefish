<p>
  Cuttlefish is a distributed neural network using tensor flow and docker containers. This is a team project by Computer Science PhD students at Pace University.

<p>
We are proposing implementing a distributed neural network using Docker containers to represent units or neurons in the a neural network. More specifically each container (neuron) will run as a service that can communicate with other neurons in the network. Our neural network will be a n layered network, implemented and configured to run on Amazon Web Service’s Elastic Container Service (ECS).
</p>
<p>
  Docker is the perfect technology for this proof of concept because by design Docker containers wrap a piece of software into a self contained unit. Software running in a container will have everything it needs to run properly including an operating system, file system and configured system resources allocated specifically for it’s needs. Docker also has a mechanism for configuring and spinning up containers that should be clustered together or that are dependencies of one another.
